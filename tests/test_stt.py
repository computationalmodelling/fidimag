def test_sst_field_1d():
    """
    This is a direct test of the STT C library
    We create a 1-D  4 spins system along the x direction with the
    following components:

               s_x   s_y   s_z       spin
            [[  0.    4.    8. ]    i = 0
             [  0.8   5.    9. ]    i = 1
             [  2.    6.   10. ]    i = 2
             [  2.1   7.   11. ]]   i = 3

    Most of the STT parameters are set to zero, so the field is reduced
    to the calculation of:

    H_STT =  j \cdot \nabla S = ( jx * d S_x / dx + jy * d S_x / dy ,
                                  jx * d S_y / dx + jy * d S_y / dy ,
                                  0)

    Therefore, the x component of the field for the 1th spin, for example,
    would be:

            H_STTx (i=1) = jx * d S_x (i=1) / dx + 0
                         = [ S_x (i=2)  -  S_x (i=0) ]  / 2 * dx
                         = ( 2 - 0 ) / 2
                         = 1

    since jx = dx = 1 and the derivatives along y are zero (1D spin chain)

    The first test is the spin chain without PBC and the second
    test is using PBCs, so the neighbours matrix changes

    ** Without PBC:
    At the extremes, the derivative has a different discretisation
    (using only the right or left neighbour and centered at the spin)
    which, for the 0th spin, for instance, is
            H_STTx (i=0) = jx * d S_x (i=0) / dx + 0
                         = [ S_x (i=1)  -  S_x (i=0) ]  / dx
                         = ( 0.8 - 0 )
                         = 0.8

    For further details, see: fidimag/atomistic/lib/stt.c

    With PBC: The derivatives at the extremes are performed with the
    periodic neighbour, e.g. for the 0th spin, the NN at -x is the 3th spin
