/* The right hand side of the LLG equation for the CVOde solver.  This can be
 * used both for the micromagnetic and atomistic codes since m or S are unitless
 * and the prefactors keep the same structure.
 *
 * The LLG equation has the structure:
 * ( * is for dot or scalar product)
 *
 *      dm        -gamma
 *     ---- =    --------  ( m X H_eff  + a * m X ( m x H_eff ) )
 *      dt             2
 *              ( 1 + a  )
 *
 * where a is the Gilbert damping constant, gamma is the gyromagnetic
 * ratio ( gamma = 1.76e11 for a free electron; for the micromagnetic
 * case, we use gamma_0 = mu_0 * gamma = 2.21e5, for a free electron),
 * m is the magnetisation vector and H_eff is the effective field.
 *
 * In our calculation, we usually compute:
 
 *      m x (m x H_eff) = ( m * H_eff) m - (m * m) H_eff
 
 * Then, if we define the perpendicular component of the effective
 * field as:
 
 *      H_perp = H_eff - ( m * H_eff) m
 
 * we can write
 
 *      dm        -gamma
 *     ---- =    --------  ( m X H_perp - a * H_perp )
 *      dt             2
 *              ( 1 + a  )
 
 * since m X m = 0 and, theoretically, m * m = 1 (at zero temperature m has
 * fixed length). However, for the second term to the right hand side,
 * proportional to a, it is better to keep the m X ( m x H_eff ) term with (m *
 * m) for stability purposes, thus we use
 *
 
 *      H_perp = (m * m) H_eff - ( m * H_eff) m
 
 * for both terms. 
 *
 * Additionally, to preserve the magnetisation length, we need to correct the
 * dm / dt term for every time step, adding the following term to the right
 * hand size expression of the LLG:
 
 *      dm              dm               2
 *     ----    --->    ---- + c * ( 1 - m  ) m
 *      dt              dt 
 
 *  with
                    _________
 *                  /        2
 *      c = 6 *    / (  dm  ) 
 *                /  ( ---- )
 *              \/   (  dt  )
 
 * The correction must be introduced since numerically, m can change length
 * during a step of the integration (which would not occur if the integration
 * step is infinitely small), deviating from the real answer. If we just
 * rescaled m, we would have to recompute the effective field (m changes) and
 * also the solution would present jumps due to the rescaling. With the term
 * specified above, m stays close to 1, giving a more continuous solution, and
 * also the term stays as zero if m is exactly 1 (notice that if m increases,
 * the correction is negative and it decreases m length; similarly if m
 * decreases). The prefactor c must be specified because the correction term
 * must be sufficiently strong to affect the solution. Accordingly, we can
 * think of dm/dt as a kind of velocity that is proportional to the change of
 * rate of m, hence using its magnitude, the correction is stronger for large
 * deviations and weak for small deviations.  The factor 6 is added ad-hoc,
* which seems to work well when computing the solutions, but its specification
* stills requires a more strict proof.  It is worth mentioning that the norm of
* dm/dt changes the time scaling by a factor proportional to 1/t, therefore in
* the future we could try to estimate its
 * influence with more mathematical/numerical rigour and analyse an optimal
 * value for the prefactor (6).
