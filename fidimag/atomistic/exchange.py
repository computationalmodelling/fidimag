                           For a square lattice the NNs are defined in 3D as:
                           [-x +x -y +y -z +z], thus the exchange components
                           are specified in that order. In a hexagonal lattice
                           the NNs are only in a 2D plane as the cardinal
                           positions: [W E NE SW NW SE].
