class DemagHexagonal(object):
    """
    This class allows to compute the Demag in a hexagonal mesh, using
    an equivalent cuboid mesh, where zeroes are appended between
    consecutive lattice sites in the original one

        The original mesh looks like

                6           7         8
                o -- -- -- o -- -- -- o

        3  o-- -- -- o -- -- -- o

                o -- -- -- o -- -- -- o
                0          1         2


        For every lattice site (--o-- in the figure), the scalar or vector
        field has associated a single value or a 3-vector.  Thus, we want to
        convert this mesh to a cuboid one, adding zero values between
        consecutive sites (spins) as follows:

            11   12                  16
            x -- o -- x -- o -- x -- o

         6  o -- x -- o -- x -- o -- x

            x -- o -- x -- o -- x -- o
            0    1    2    3    4   5

        Things to notice:
            * Every row has now the double number of nodes in the x direction,
              i.e. 2 * nx
            * The lattice spacing between cosequtive sites are half of those
              in the hexagonal lattice x (the y distance is the same),
              hence dx_c = 0.5 * dx
            * Even rows zeroes start from the 0th column while in odd
              rows, the start from the 1st column

        To convert scalar or vector fields to the new cuboid mesh, two
        functions are defined: scalar2cuboid and vector2cuboid.

        A vector field array has the structure:

        The cuboid vector field has 2 times the length of the original
        vector field array.

        The procedure is similar to the one in the scalar field, the only
        difference is in the reshaping of the vector field arrays. We
        make it such that instead of a single value, we use 3 vectors, thus
        we have a 3 dimensional matrix where every row has still nx or 2 * nx
        values.

        For example, in a 2 * 3 system:

        Original: vector_field = [ 0,  1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  6,  7,  8,  9, 10,
                                   11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17]

        Reshaped: [ [ [ 0,  1,  2], [ 3,  4,  5] ],

                  So we have 2 sites per row,as the original system, where
                  a 3-vector is associated to each entry, making a
                  (2, 3, 3) matrix --> (ny, nx, 3) in general

                  Thus, for the cuboid version, we would have the double
                  of columns, i.e. a (ny, 2 * nx, 3) matrix and copy
                  the elements as in the scalar field
