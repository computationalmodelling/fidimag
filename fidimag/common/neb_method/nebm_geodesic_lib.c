     * [Computer Physics Communications 196 (2015) 335â€“347]
     *
     * INPUTS:

     *                 where mx_i is the x component of the i-th spin of image
     *                 A
     *
     * n_dofs_image :: Number of degrees of freedom (total number of spin
     *                 components) per image, which is basically the length of
     *                 the A or B arrays. Since we assume Cartesian
     *                 coordinates, the number of spins is just:
     *                      n_dofs_image / 3
     *
     * material     :: An array of size (3 * n_spins), containing only 1 and 0s
     *                 For every spin, its value is repeated 3 times (the number
     *                 of dofs). The values of material is 1 where mu_s or M_s
     *                 are larger than zero.
     *                 This array is not necessary here since sites without
     *                 material do not change their magnetisation and thus they
     *                 do not contribute to the Geodesic distance magnitude
     *
     * Vicenty's formula is defined by computing the distance between
     * corresponding spins of the images A and B. So, if we have m(A)_i as
     * the i-th spin of the A image, then the geodesic distance L is defined
     * as:
     *                _____________________________________________________
     *               /
     *      L = /\  / l(A, B)_0 ^ 2 + l(A, B)_0 ^ 2 + ... + l(A, B)_(N) ^ 2
     *            \/
     *
     *  where N = (n_dofs_image - 1) and
     *
     *                                 ->       ->        ->       ->
     *          l(A, B)_i = arctan2( | m(A)_i X m(B)_i |, m(A)_i o m(B)_i )
     *                                                     (dot product)
